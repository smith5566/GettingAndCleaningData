Getting and Cleaning Data
********************************

This dataset was assembled according to the guidelines for the Course Project assignment
in the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" class (May 5th start date). The data was downloaded
from the Course Project webpage link to:

Study Design
====================
The experiments involved 30 subjects performing six activities (see below) while wearing
a Samsung Galaxy S II on the waist. Using the device embedded acceleromter and gyroscope,
linear acceleration and angular velocity were recorded along three axes (x, y, z). 70% of volunteers were placed into a
"train" group to train the data and 30% into a group that provided the test data. 

For more information concerning the study design, please visit the above website.


Summary Choices
======================
In accordance with the Course Project requirements, the selected data the averages of the mean
and standard deviation variables by each subject and activity. Any variables that were a calculated
mean or standard deviation of the activity were included, as determined by either the
"mean" or "std" strings in the variable measure labels.
This data was shaped into a new data frame of 180 observations of 81 variables.

Code Book
==================
Features/Variable Measures - Columns 3 through 81 (normalized[-1, 1] continuous data type)
------------------

Features were collected from the acceleromter and gyroscope raw signals along x, y, and z axes. 
All data are normalized[-1, 1] values run through mathematical models. See above website
for detailed description of mathematical models.

The features/variable labels are a combination of readable codes. The translation schema is as follows:

	-Prefix: "t" denotes time domain signals measured at a constant rate of 50 mHz.
			 "f" denotes a Fast Fourier Transform was applied to signals.
			 
	-Either "body" or "gravity" is included as a measurement type.
	
	-"acc" or "gyro" denotes whether data is from accelerometer or gyroscope, respectively.
	
	- "mean" or "standarddeviation" denotes whether data is a mean or a standard deviation, respectively.
	
	- Suffix: "x", "y", or "z" denotes where measurement is along the x, y, or z axis, respectively.
	
Example column name breakdown: 
	tbodyaccmeanx - denotes time domain signal, body measurement, accelerometer readings, mean of readings, along x axis.
	
Subject Labels - Column 1 (numerical cardinal data type, integers between 1 and 6)
-------------------
Subject values denote an subject code identifier (protecting subject anonymity). 9 of the subjects
were in the test group, 21 subjects were in the train group (30%/70% split).

Subject codes 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24 correlate to the test group;
Subject codes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21 ,22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
correlate to the train group.

Activity Labels - Column 2 (character string cardinal data type).
------------------------
Activity labels denote the activity performed during the measurement recordings. There are six activities:
Walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.
